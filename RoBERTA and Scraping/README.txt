Other attempted include:

scraping descriptions from other sites (farfetch, ssense, nordstrom) and train own roberta embeddings : cred to https://colab.research.google.com/gist/aditya-malte/2d4f896f471be9c38eb4d723a710768b/smallberta_pretraining.ipynb

pytorch model concatenate bert embedding output with categorical variables (brand, category, etc)
